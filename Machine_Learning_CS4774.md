## Class 1: 
- *Machine Learning*: The field of study that gives the computers the ability to learn with out being explicitly programmed

- Traditional Programming: Data and Program -> computer -> output
- Machine Learning: Data and Output -> computer -> program
- Machine Learning is a subfield of AI: AI > ML > Deep Learning
- Machine Learning Algorithm: to learn from experience with respect from some task T and some performance P if improves with E
-   The Task (T):
