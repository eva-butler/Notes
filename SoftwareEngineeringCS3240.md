GitHub
- main should always be deployable

### Software Process and Methodologies

A process
- find and repeat good practices
- management - > need to know what to do next, and keep things on track

Software Procss:
-  software process is a set of activities that take place in sequence in the pursuit of creation of a software system
  - requirements
  - specifications
  - desgin
  - development
  - validation
  - evolution
- the form/iteration/timing/ect. of these activities defines the different methodoligies
- These methods can fall on the continuum between an Agile and Plan-Driven method

MODELS:
- waterfall
  - do the phases shown before in order
  - complete one phase before moving onto the next
  - a well defined document with the layout
  - very rigid
- spiral
  - basically the waterfall method that can circle back and run through the process multiple times
  - risk analysis and management are explicity shown in the model at each stage
  - repititon of activities in model

- various agile methods
  - Scrum, Extreme Programming, Kanban
- various plan-driven methods
  - Plan-driven methods work best when developers can determine the requirements in advance . . . and when the requirements remain relatively stable, with change rates on the order of one percent per month.‚Äù
  - Depending on how they are implemented, they can be more plan-driven or more agile
  - Focus on repeatability and predictability
  - Documentation
  - Rational Unified Process
    - 1980s, built around the UML (unified modeling language), toolsets were created to hep build UML diagrams, and then translate them into code
    - incorportated into multiple IDEs
    - Built around six best practices:
      - Develop software iteratively
      - Manage requirements
      - Use component-based architectures
      - Visually model software
      - Verify software qualit
      - Control changes to software
  - Personal Software Process
  - Team Software Process
  - 
- other families of approaches
