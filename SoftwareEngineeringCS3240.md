### Software Process and Methodologies

A process
- find and repeat good practices
- management - > need to know what to do next, and keep things on track

Software Procss:
-  software process is a set of activities that take place in sequence in the pursuit of creation of a software system
  - requirements
  - specifications
  - desgin
  - development
  - validation
  - evolution
- the form/iteration/timing/ect. of these activities defines the different methodoligies
- These methods can fall on the continuum between an Agile and Plan-Driven method

MODELS:
- waterfall
  - do the phases shown before in order
  - complete one phase before moving onto the next
  - a well defined document with the layout
  - very rigid
- spiral
  - basically the waterfall method that can circle back and run through the process multiple times
  - risk analysis and management are explicity shown in the model at each stage
  - repititon of activities in model
  - <img width="214" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd7cfe56-1865-444e-bcde-8b6303d7c4f0">

- various agile methods
  - Scrum, Extreme Programming, Kanban
- various plan-driven methods
  - Plan-driven methods work best when developers can determine the requirements in advance . . . and when the requirements remain relatively stable, with change rates on the order of one percent per month.”
  - Depending on how they are implemented, they can be more plan-driven or more agile
  - Focus on repeatability and predictability
  - Documentation
  - Rational Unified Process
    - 1980s, built around the UML (unified modeling language), toolsets were created to hep build UML diagrams, and then translate them into code
    - incorportated into multiple IDEs
    - Built around six best practices:
      - Develop software iteratively
      - Manage requirements
      - Use component-based architectures
      - Visually model software
      - Verify software qualit
      - Control changes to software
  - Personal Software Process
  - Team Software Process
  - 
- other families of approaches


## Django Practice:

### part 1)
- django-admin startproject mysite
begin the project
These files are:

The outer mysite/ root directory is a container for your project. Its name doesn’t matter to Django; you can rename it to anything you like.
manage.py: A command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project in various ways. You can read all the details about manage.py in django-admin and manage.py.
The inner mysite/ directory is the actual Python package for your project. Its name is the Python package name you’ll need to use to import anything inside it (e.g. mysite.urls).
mysite/__init__.py: An empty file that tells Python that this directory should be considered a Python package. If you’re a Python beginner, read more about packages in the official Python docs.
mysite/settings.py: Settings/configuration for this Django project. Django settings will tell you all about how settings work.
mysite/urls.py: The URL declarations for this Django project; a “table of contents” of your Django-powered site. You can read more about URLs in URL dispatcher.
mysite/asgi.py: An entry-point for ASGI-compatible web servers to serve your project. See How to deploy with ASGI for more details.
mysite/wsgi.py: An entry-point for WSGI-compatible web servers to serve your project. See How to deploy with WSGI for more details.


After making a new app:
python manage.py startapp polls
you create the following directory:

polls/
    __init__.py
    admin.py
    apps.py
    migrations/
        __init__.py
    models.py
    tests.py
    views.py
      - the http response is teh mist basic view in Django. You can map the response to a url

make a urls.py to connect to the views.py

The next step is to configure the global URLconf in the mysite project to include the URLconf defined in polls.urls. To do this, add an import for django.urls.include in mysite/urls.py and insert an include() in the urlpatterns list, so you have:

    from django.contrib import admin
    from django.urls import include, path
    
    urlpatterns = [
        path("polls/", include("polls.urls")),
        path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
    ]

You should always use include() when you include other URL patterns. admin.site.urls is the only exception to this.

path()
- The path() function is passed four arguments, two required: route and view, and two optional: kwargs, and name. At this point, it’s worth reviewing what these arguments are for.
  - route: a string that contains a URL pattern. When processing a request, Django starts at the first pattern in urlpatterns and makes its way down the list, comparing the requested URL against each pattern until it finds one that matches.
  - view: When Django finds a matching pattern, it calls the specified view function with an HttpRequest object as the first argument and any “captured” values from the route as keyword arguments.
  - name: Naming your URL lets you refer to it unambiguously from elsewhere in Django, especially from within templates. This powerful feature allows you to make global changes to the URL patterns of your project while only touching a single file.
 
### part 2) Database set up

settings.py
- TIME_ZONE: set it when u edit
- INSTALLED_APPS: names of all Django applications that are activated in this Django instance. Apps can be used in multiple projects, and you can package and distribute them for use by others in their projects. FOlliwing are the default apps included
  - django.contrib.admin – The admin site. You’ll use it shortly.
  - django.contrib.auth – An authentication system.
  - django.contrib.contenttypes – A framework for content types.
  - django.contrib.sessions – A session framework.
  - django.contrib.messages – A messaging framework.
  - django.contrib.staticfiles – A framework for managing static files.
- migrate:
  - The migrate command looks at the INSTALLED_APPS setting and creates any necessary database tables according to the database settings in your mysite/settings.py file and the database migrations shipped with the app (we’ll cover those later). 
Creating Models:
- A model is the single, definitive source of information about your data. It contains the essential fields and behaviors of the data you’re storing. Django follows the DRY Principle. The goal is to define your data model in one place and automatically derive things from it.
- This includes the migrations - unlike in Ruby On Rails, for example, migrations are entirely derived from your models file, and are essentially a history that Django can roll through to update your database schema to match your current models.
- In our poll app, we’ll create two models: Question and Choice. A Question has a question and a publication date. A Choice has two fields: the text of the choice and a vote tally. Each Choice is associated with a Question.
    
      class Question(models.Model):
          question_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
          pub_date = models.DateTimeField("date published")
      
      
      class Choice(models.Model):
          question = models.ForeignKey(Question, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
          choice_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
          votes = models.IntegerField(default=0)

- Here, each model is represented by a class that subclasses django.db.models.Model. Each model has a number of class variables, each of which represents a database field in the model.
- Each field is represented by an instance of a Field class – e.g., CharField for character fields and DateTimeField for datetimes. This tells Django what type of data each field holds.
- The name of each Field instance (e.g. question_text or pub_date) is the field’s name, in machine-friendly format. You’ll use this value in your Python code, and your database will use it as the column name.
- Finally, note a relationship is defined, using ForeignKey. That tells Django each Choice is related to a single Question. Django supports all the common database relationships: many-to-one, many-to-many, and one-to-one.

Activating Models:
- Django apps are “pluggable”: You can use an app in multiple projects, and you can distribute apps, because they don’t have to be tied to a given Django installation.
- onfiguration class in the INSTALLED_APPS setting. The PollsConfig class is in the polls/apps.py file, so its dotted path is 'polls.apps.PollsConfig'. Edit the mysite/settings.py file and add that dotted path to the INSTALLED_APPS setting. It’ll look like this:
- makemigrations
  - $ python manage.py makemigrations polls
  - By running makemigrations, you’re telling Django that you’ve made some changes to your models (in this case, you’ve made new ones) and that you’d like the changes to be stored as a migration.
- sqlmigrate:
  - command takes migration names and returns their SQL:
  - python manage.py sqlmigrate polls 0001
  - Table names are automatically generated by combining the name of the app (polls) and the lowercase name of the model – question and choice.
  - Primary keys (IDs) are added automatically. (You can override this, too.)
  - The foreign key relationship is made explicit by a FOREIGN KEY constraint. Don’t worry about the DEFERRABLE parts; it’s telling PostgreSQL to not enforce the foreign key until the end of the transaction.
  - The sqlmigrate command doesn’t actually run the migration on your database - instead, it prints it to the screen so that you can see what SQL Django thinks is required. It’s useful for checking what Django is going to do or if you have database administrators who require SQL scripts for changes.
  - We’ll cover them in more depth in a later part of the tutorial, but for now, remember the three-step guide to making model changes:
    - Change your models (in models.py)
    - Run python manage.py makemigrations to create migrations for those changes
    - Run python manage.py migrate to apply those changes to the database.

Introducing the Django Admin
- Generating admin sites for your staff or clients to add, change, and delete content is tedious work that doesn’t require much creativity. For that reason, Django entirely automates creation of admin interfaces for models.

      (base) root@Eva:~/code/CS3240/django-eva-butler# python manage.py createsuperuser
      Username (leave blank to use 'root'): admin
      Email address: admin@example.com
      Password: 
      Password (again): 
      Superuser created successfully.

      from django.contrib import admin
      
      from .models import Question
      
      admin.site.register(Question)

  - this makes the poll modifyable in the admin


  ### part 3)

- A view is a “type” of web page in your Django application that generally serves a specific function and has a specific template. For example, in a blog application, you might have the following views:

- Blog homepage – displays the latest few entries.
- Entry “detail” page – permalink page for a single entry.
- year-based archive page – displays all months with entries in the given year.
- Month-based archive page – displays all days with entries in the given month.
- Day-based archive page – displays all entries in the given day.
- Comment action – handles posting comments to a given entry.
- In our poll application, we’ll have the following four views:
  - Question “index” page – displays the latest few questions
  - Question “detail” page – displays a question text, with no results but with a form to vote.
  - Question “results” page – displays results for a particular question.
  - Vote action – handles voting for a part

- Each view is represented by a python function

Writing more views:

Adding more views and updating path:
    
    from django.urls import path
    
    from . import views
    
    def detail(request, question_id):
        return HttpResponse("You're looking at question %s." % question_id)
    
    
    def results(request, question_id):
        response = "You're looking at the results of question %s."
        return HttpResponse(response % question_id)
    
    
    def vote(request, question_id):
        return HttpResponse("You're voting on question %s." % question_id)

    urlpatterns = [
        # ex: /polls/
        path("", views.index, name="index"),
        # ex: /polls/5/
        path("<int:question_id>/", views.detail, name="detail"),
        # ex: /polls/5/results/
        path("<int:question_id>/results/", views.results, name="results"),
        # ex: /polls/5/vote/
        path("<int:question_id>/vote/", views.vote, name="vote"),
    ]

The question_id=34 part comes from <int:question_id>. Using angle brackets “captures” part of the URL and sends it as a keyword argument to the view function. The question_id part of the string defines the name that will be used to identify the matched pattern, and the int part is a converter that determines what patterns should match this part of the URL path. The colon (:) separates the converter and pattern name.

Write views that actually do something
- Each view is responsible for doing one of two things: returning an HttpResponse object containing the content for the requested page, or raising an exception such as Http404. The rest is up to you.
- Your project’s TEMPLATES setting describes how Django will load and render templates. The default settings file configures a DjangoTemplates backend whose APP_DIRS option is set to True. By convention DjangoTemplates looks for a “templates” subdirectory in each of the INSTALLED_APPS.
- Template namespacing: Now we might be able to get away with putting our templates directly in polls/templates (rather than creating another polls subdirectory), but it would actually be a bad idea. Django will choose the first template it finds whose name matches, and if you had a template with the same name in a different application, Django would be unable to distinguish between them. We need to be able to point Django at the right one, and the best way to ensure this is by namespacing them. That is, by putting those templates inside another directory named for the application itself.

render(): The render() function takes the request object as its first argument, a template name as its second argument and a dictionary as its optional third argument. It returns an HttpResponse object of the given template rendered with the given context.

    from django.shortcuts import render
    
    from .models import Question
    
    
    def index(request):
        latest_question_list = Question.objects.order_by("-pub_date")[:5]
        context = {"latest_question_list": latest_question_list}
        return render(request, "polls/index.html", context)

Raising 404 errors:

def detail(request, question_id):
    try:
        question = Question.objects.get(pk=question_id)
    except Question.DoesNotExist:
        raise Http404("Question does not exist")
    return render(request, "polls/detail.html", {"question": question})

get_object_or_404() :takes a Django model as its first argument and an arbitrary number of keyword arguments, which it passes to the get() function of the model’s manager. It raises Http404 if the object doesn’t exist.

    def detail(request, question_id):
        question = get_object_or_404(Question, pk=question_id)
        return render(request, "polls/detail.html", {"question": question})


## Part 4)
- Html form element:

      <form action="{% url 'polls:vote' question.id %}" method="post">
      {% csrf_token %}
      <fieldset>
          <legend><h1>{{ question.question_text }}</h1></legend>
          {% if error_message %}<p><strong>{{ error_message }}</strong></p>{% endif %}
          {% for choice in question.choice_set.all %}
              <input type="radio" name="choice" id="choice{{ forloop.counter }}" value="{{ choice.id }}">
              <label for="choice{{ forloop.counter }}">{{ choice.choice_text }}</label><br>
          {% endfor %}
      </fieldset>
      <input type="submit" value="Vote">
      </form>
- The above template displays a radio button for each question choice. The value of each radio button is the associated question choice’s ID. The name of each radio button is "choice". That means, when somebody selects one of the radio buttons and submits the form, it’ll send the POST data choice=# where # is the ID of the selected choice. This is the basic concept of HTML forms.
- We set the form’s action to {% url 'polls:vote' question.id %}, and we set method="post". Using method="post" (as opposed to method="get") is very important, because the act of submitting this form will alter data server-side. Whenever you create a form that alters data server-side, use method="post". This tip isn’t specific to Django; it’s good web development practice in general.
- forloop.counter indicates how many times the for tag has gone through its loop

Writing a new Vote Function:

      def vote(request, question_id):
          question = get_object_or_404(Question, pk=question_id)
          try:
              selected_choice = question.choice_set.get(pk=request.POST["choice"])
          except (KeyError, Choice.DoesNotExist):
              # Redisplay the question voting form.
              return render(
                  request,
                  "polls/detail.html",
                  {
                      "question": question,
                      "error_message": "You didn't select a choice.",
                  },
              )
          else:
              selected_choice.votes = F("votes") + 1
              selected_choice.save()
          return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse("polls:results", args=(question.id,)))

- request.POST is a dictionary-like object that lets you access submitted data by key name. In this case, request.POST['choice'] returns the ID of the selected choice, as a string. request.POST values are always strings.

- Note that Django also provides request.GET for accessing GET data in the same way – but we’re explicitly using request.POST in our code, to ensure that data is only altered via a POST call.

- request.POST['choice'] will raise KeyError if choice wasn’t provided in POST data. The above code checks for KeyError and redisplays the question form with an error message if choice isn’t given.

- F("votes") + 1 instructs the database to increase the vote count by 1.

- After incrementing the choice count, the code returns an HttpResponseRedirect rather than a normal HttpResponse. HttpResponseRedirect takes a single argument: the URL to which the user will be redirected (see the following point for how we construct the URL in this case).

- As the Python comment above points out, you should always return an HttpResponseRedirect after successfully dealing with POST data. This tip isn’t specific to Django; it’s good web development practice in general.

- We are using the reverse() function in the HttpResponseRedirect constructor in this example. This function helps avoid having to hardcode a URL in the view function. It is given the name of the view that we want to pass control to and the variable portion of the URL pattern that points to that view. In this case, using the URLconf we set up in Tutorial 3, this reverse() call will return a string like

 Using Generic Views: The less code the better
- Let’s convert our poll app to use the generic views system, so we can delete a bunch of our own code. We’ll have to take a few steps to make the conversion. We will:
  - Convert the URLconf.
  - Delete some of the old, unneeded views.
  - Introduce new views based on Django’s generic views.
 
- Each generic view needs to know what model it will be acting upon. This is provided using either the model attribute (in this example, model = Question for DetailView and ResultsView) or by defining the get_queryset() method (as shown in IndexView).

- By default, the DetailView generic view uses a template called <app name>/<model name>_detail.html. In our case, it would use the template "polls/question_detail.html". The template_name attribute is used to tell Django to use a specific template name instead of the autogenerated default template name. We also specify the template_name for the results list view – this ensures that the results view and the detail view have a different appearance when rendered, even though they’re both a DetailView behind the scenes.

- Similarly, the ListView generic view uses a default template called <app name>/<model name>_list.html; we use template_name to tell ListView to use our existing "polls/index.html" template.

## part 5)
Introduced automated testing

This is the first test we are going to try to catch the error of future questions being considered published recently
    
    import datetime
    
    from django.test import TestCase
    from django.utils import timezone
    
    from .models import Question
    
    
    class QuestionModelTests(TestCase):
        def test_was_published_recently_with_future_question(self):
            """
            was_published_recently() returns False for questions whose pub_date
            is in the future.
            """
            time = timezone.now() + datetime.timedelta(days=30)
            future_question = Question(pub_date=time)
            self.assertIs(future_question.was_published_recently(), False)

- Here we have created a django.test.TestCase subclass with a method that creates a Question instance with a pub_date in the future. We then check the output of was_published_recently() - which ought to be False.
- What happened is this:
  - manage.py test polls looked for tests in the polls application
  - it found a subclass of the django.test.TestCase class
  - it created a special database for the purpose of testing
  - it looked for test methods - ones whose names begin with test
  - in test_was_published_recently_with_future_question it created a Question instance whose pub_date field is 30 days in the future
  - and using the assertIs() method, it discovered that its was_published_recently() returns True, though we wanted it to return False

The Django Test Client
- Django provides a test Client to simulate a user interacting with the code at the view level. We can use it in tests.py or even in the shell.
- We will start again with the shell, where we need to do a couple of things that won’t be necessary in tests.py. The first is to set up the test environment in the shell:

      >>> from django.test.utils import setup_test_environment
      >>> setup_test_environment()

- setup_test_environment() installs a template renderer which will allow us to examine some additional attributes on responses such as response.context that otherwise wouldn’t be available. Note that this method does not set up a test database, so the following will be run against the existing database and the output may differ slightly depending on what questions you already created. You might get unexpected results if your TIME_ZONE in settings.py isn’t correct. If you don’t remember setting it earlier, check it before continuing.
      
      >>> from django.test import Client
      >>> # create an instance of the client for our use
      >>> client = Client()
      >>> >>> # get a response from '/'
      >>> response = client.get("/")
      Not Found: /
      >>> # we should expect a 404 from that address; if you instead see an
      >>> # "Invalid HTTP_HOST header" error and a 400 response, you probably
      >>> # omitted the setup_test_environment() call described earlier.
      >>> response.status_code

## part 6)
Customizing the Apps Look and Feel 
- First, create a directory called static in your polls directory. Django will look for static files there, similarly to how Django finds templates inside polls/templates/.

- Django’s STATICFILES_FINDERS setting contains a list of finders that know how to discover static files from various sources. One of the defaults is AppDirectoriesFinder which looks for a “static” subdirectory in each of the INSTALLED_APPS, like the one in polls we just created. The admin site uses the same directory structure for its static files.

- Within the static directory you have just created, create another directory called polls and within that create a file called style.css. In other words, your stylesheet should be at polls/static/polls/style.css. Because of how the AppDirectoriesFinder staticfile finder works, you can refer to this static file in Django as polls/style.css, similar to how you reference the path for templates.
